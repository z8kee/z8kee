## Hi there 👋

Im Ezekiel, a Computer Science undergraduate based in England.

I usually work with the backend, preferably data analysis and machine learning -- Python, SQL, Java

Currently working on a biomechanical analysis project that analyses an athlete's running form using a temporal 1D CNN and a static model, will feed my collected data into it.

Starting from anew, I will continue to build my skills through contributions and projects. Join me on this journey.

## Fun Facts

- I'm a 100m/200m sprinter, gymnast
- Like solving mathematical theories (sometimes)
